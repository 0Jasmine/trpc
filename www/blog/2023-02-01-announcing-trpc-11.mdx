Today we're releasing tRPC **version 11**, the most boring major release of tRPC yet.

Version **11** of tRPC comes with no new features, but it does come with of a lot of internal improvements & removal of `@deprecated` functionality.

## Overview of changes

We've mainly been removing code.

### Removal of `.interop()`-mode

In version 10, we wanted to make sure we could support a smooth migration path for existing tRPC users. To do this, we introduced a new `.interop()`-mode that allowed you to use the new v10 syntax while still using the v9 router.

This was a great way to ease into the new syntax, but it also meant that we had to maintain two different routers. This was a lot of work and we've decided to remove the `.interop()`-mode in v11.

If you're still using the `.interop()`-mode, you can migrate to the new syntax by following the [migration guide](https://trpc.io/docs/v10/migrate-from-v9-to-v10).

### A lot of refactoring

Because we've removed the `.interop()`-mode, we've been able to remove a lot of code from tRPC. This has made the codebase a lot easier to work with and has also makes it easier to add new features.

This is especially true for the `@trpc/react-query` and the `@trpc/client`-packages that included a lot of code that was only used for the `.interop()`-mode.

## Migration path

The migration path from version 10 to version 11 is very straight-forward - most people can just do `npx npm-check-updates --filter /trpc/ -u` and then `npm install` to get the latest version.

## Thank you!

Thanks for using and supporting tRPC.
